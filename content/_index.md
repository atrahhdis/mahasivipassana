# Welcome to Mahasi Vipassana Meditation Resources (MVMR)

Here you will find all the required information in order to learn the practice of **Vipassana (Insight) meditation**, as taught by Venerable [Mahasi Sayadaw]({{< ref "bio.md" >}}).

**Mahasi Vipassana** meditation technique is widely known as **"Mahasi noting"**.


## How to use this website

It is highly suggested to read all related Mahasi Sayadaw's texts offered by MVMR, as this will help you understand the technique in depth. 

However, if you want to learn the basics in order to get going with your practice, you can:

- Read: 

  - [Practical Vipassana meditation exercises]({{< ref "practical-vipassana-meditation-exercises.md" >}}) (the shortest available introduction to noting)

  - [Practical Insight Meditation: Basic Practice]({{< ref "practical-insight-meditation-basic-practice.md" >}}) (the most popular text by Mahasi Sayadaw)
  - [Q&A with Mahasi Sayadaw]({{< ref "mahasi-q&a.md" >}})

## What to read next

Although the material provided on this website is more than enough to get you started, if you want to get a deeper knowledge on Mahasi Vipassana, you can read his book [The Manual of Insight]({{< ref "the-manual-of-insight.md" >}}).

&nbsp;
## Caution

There is a popular notion that meditation practice comes with exclusively beneficial/positive experiences and outcomes. [This is not true](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0176239).

People interested in insight meditation, are highly suggested to [become aware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jv-DjlScpV8) of the [possible adverse effects](https://vimeo.com/378177771) of such practices.

## Note

[The person](https://ahtrahddis.github.io/info) behind [MVMR]({{< ref "_index.md" >}}) is far from being considered an expert in Mahasi Vipassana or meditation practice in general and thus is unable to provide any guidance or advice.

This website was created by secular Buddhist **beginner** and is nothing more than a "personal notebook" published online, aiming to be a helpful resource for other people around the world with the same interest in insight meditation.
