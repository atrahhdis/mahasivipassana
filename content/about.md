# About

## People behind MVMR

MVMR was created by a **beginner**. It is the result of an effort to gather together as much information as possible regarding the technique of **Mahasi Vipassana**, aiming to make it a useful resource for other practitioners around the world.

Please note that this is a website created [by a secular Buddhist](https://ahtrahddis.eu/info) who is not affiliated with the Mahasi or any other relevant lineages.

## Website software

MVMR was created using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [hugo book theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book). 

## Sources

You can browse MVMR sources [on Github](https://github.com/atrahhdis/mahasivipassana).

[All texts](https://github.com/atrahhdis/mahasivipassana/tree/master/content/docs) were written using [Ghostwriter](https://wereturtle.github.io/ghostwriter/) and [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). 


## E-books

All e-books offered on MVMR are based on freely distributed Dharma material.

### Software

For the creation of the e-books, **Markdown (MD)** [files](https://github.com/atrahhdis/mahasivipassana/tree/master/static/downloads/md) were converted to **EPUB** using [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

**EPUB** testing and debugging, metadata handling and **EPUB** to **AZW3**/**MOBI** (both of them for kindle devices) conversion were done using [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).

**AZW3** (kindle) files were further processed using [Hyphenate This!](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=208534) plugin.
